            <h4><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></h4>
            <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly everyone that has
                been published), almost every email I've ever written has been written by machines created by Apple. I interacted online using
                an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid.
                And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for your amazing work.

            <h4><strong>He's Gone...</strong></h4>
            <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer, media proprietor,
                and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar

            <h4><strong>Condolence</strong></h4>
            <p>Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and
                studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained
                fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial
                potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI).

            <h4><strong>so sad</strong></h4>
            <p>This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced
                computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first
                laser printer to feature vector graphics.
